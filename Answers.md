1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

A: React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces and applications. React solves the problem of scalability by creating a more efficient way to manage data. It provides a smooth and efficient user experience within an application using the virtual DOM. This power in turn takes pressure of the browser and the devleoper. React JS was created by the developers at facebook to create a system whereby utilizing the reusability of components and class constructors and accessing the virtual DOM to create a website constantly chaning by user input.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

A: To think in React means to break down an application into smaller UI elements and build those pieces into reusable components. These components can then be built up and interact with one another in a given hierachy to build the application or webpage. Depending on the given heirarchy a developer established these higher components that can then handle more complex actions than an application without React JS that can establish, hold, and pass around its own state/data.

3.  Describe state.

A: State is the data that components has access to. The state object is set up on the class component constructor. That component's state can then be used by other components through interpolation. State can be set and is mutable; state can change based on the component's current data.

4.  Describe props.

A: Props stand for properties and those Props are used when state is passed around from one component to another. Props are immutable; you cannot mutate props in any way.
